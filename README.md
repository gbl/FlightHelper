# FlightHelper
When you're Elytra flying, you probably want to maintain your pitch to get the maximum distance, or flight time, from your rockets. And while firing a rocket you want to have a pitch that leads you straight up.

 

This mod helps with that:

 

*    Press the Numpad 8 key to lock your pitch to "up" while using fireworks  - -55 degrees normally, but changable in config
*    Press the Numpad 2 key to lock your pitch to "glide" - 2.2 degrees normally, but changeable as well
*    Press Numpad 5 to unlock your pitch again

While the pitch is locked, you can turn around as much as you want to without accidentially changing your pitch.

 

This mod does not need any server support, so it should be fine to use on your server (but ask admins if server policy allows it).

To make sure the mod doesn't slow down your minecraft,
